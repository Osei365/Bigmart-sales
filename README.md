## PROJECT TO PREDICT BIGMART SUPERMARKET SALES

### BACKROUND INFORMATION
The project is basically about building a model that will learn from data collected from Big mart supermarkets at varying locations and use what it learns to predict future sales prices.   
The data comprises of twelve(12) columns namely:
> Item_Identifier  
> Item_Weight                     
> Item_Fat_Content                
> Item_Visibility                 
> Item_Type                       
> Item_MRP                        
> Outlet_Identifier               
> Outlet_Establishment_Year       
> Outlet_Size                  
> Outlet_Location_Type            
> Outlet_Type 
> Item_Outlet_Sales

The _**Item_Outlet_Sles**_ is the target variable while the others will form the features for the model. 

### Project summary
1. **Data cleaning**
  - there were two colums present in the data that had numerous missing values. Therefore some data cleaning was done to fill in the missing values
2. **Data Exploration**
  - the data was explored to discover relationships between variables/features in the data to help inform the modelling technique
3. **Modelling**
  - four different models were used to train the data and the rsults of the four were averaged using vectprised programming
